   <b> <p>Fashion is a form of self-expression and autonomy at a particular period and place and in a specific context,
         of clothing, footwear, lifestyle, accessories, makeup, hairstyle, and body posture. The term implies a look
          defined by the fashion industry as that which is trending. Everything that is considered fashion is available 
          and popularized by the fashion system. </p></b>
         <br><br>
       <b>  <p1>The French word mode, meaning "fashion", dates as far back as 1482, while the English word denoting
             something "in style" dates only to the 16th century. Other words exist related to concepts of style
              and appeal that precede mode. In the 12th and 13th century Old French the concept of elegance begins
               to appear in the context of aristocratic preferences to enhance beauty and display refinement, and
                cointerie, the idea of making oneself more attractive to others by style or artifice in grooming
                 and dress, appears in a 13th-century poem by Guillaume de Lorris advising men that "handsome clothes
                  and handsome accessories improve a man a great deal".</p1></b>
