    <h1 align="center"><b><u>GERMINATION</b></u></h1>
<li>Germination, the sprouting of a seed, spore, or other reproductive body, usually after a period of dormancy. The absorption of water, the passage of time, chilling, warming, oxygen availability, and light exposure may all operate in initiating the process.</li><br>
<li>In the process of seed germination, water is absorbed by the embryo, which results in the rehydration and expansion of the cells. Shortly after the beginning of water uptake, or imbibition, the rate of respiration increases, and various metabolic processes, suspended or much reduced during dormancy, resume. </li><br>
<li>These events are associated with structural changes in the organelles (membranous bodies concerned with metabolism), in the cells of the</li><br>
<li>Germination sometimes occurs early in the development process; the mangrove (Rhizophora) embryo develops within the ovule, pushing out a swollen rudimentary root through the still-attached flower. </li><br>
<li>In peas and corn (maize) the cotyledons (seed leaves) remain underground (e.g., hypogeal germination), while in other species (beans, sunflowers, etc.) the hypocotyl (embryonic stem) grows several inches above the ground, carrying the cotyledons into the light, in which they become green and often leaflike (e.g., epigeal germination).
</li><br>
<h1 align="center"><u><b>SEED DEMANCY</b></u></h2>
<li>Dormancy is brief for some seeds—for example, those of certain short-lived annual plants. After dispersal and under appropriate environmental conditions, such as suitable temperature and access to water and oxygen, the seed germinates, and the embryo resumes growth.</li><br>
<li>The seeds of many species do not germinate immediately after exposure to conditions generally favourable for plant growth but require a “breaking” of dormancy, which may be associated with change in the seed coats or with the state of the embryo itself. </li><br>
<li>Commonly, the embryo has no innate dormancy and will develop after the seed coat is removed or sufficiently damaged to allow water to enter. Germination in such cases depends upon rotting or abrasion of the seed coat in the gut of an animal or in the soil.</li><br>
<li>In many seeds the embryo cannot germinate even under suitable conditions until a certain period of time has lapsed. The time may be required for continued embryonic development in the seed or for some necessary finishing process—known as afterripening—the nature of which remains obscure</li><br>
