    <p>A plant nursery is a place that starts the growing process for plants and trees.
         The plants are started with seedlings or seeds and are grown to a size that is desirable to farmers, landscapers, retail stores, and home gardeners.
          The plants are used in landscapes, lawns, vegetable gardens, and other indoor and outdoor plant and flower aesthetics.

Plant nurseries range in size from private backyard nurseries to large plots of land and can specialize in fruits and vegetables or exotic trees and shrubs.
 The types of plants and trees that are grown in the nursery will depend on the market demand and region.

Once grown, plant nurseries sell many types of plants and trees to wholesale and retail nurseries.
 These nurseries are where customers can purchase a wide range of plants or young trees for farms, gardens, and more.
  These garden centers are also the place to go when you want information or advice about plants, soil, fertilizers, garden tools, and more.
  There are a variety of ways for a nursery to care and grow plants. Shrubs and small trees that are sold in garden centers need to be grown in containers while ornamental trees will need open fields to thrive. There are plants that will need to be shielded from outdoor elements while having access to sunlight. Such plants will need to be protected, grown, and cared for in greenhouses or plastic tunnels. Greenhouses are building structures used by nurseries for seedlings and saplings. The controlled environment allows the plants to grow and survive during the colder months. They are also used by nurseries to grow non-native and exotic plants.

Greenhouses are equipped with advanced features like automated ventilation, temperature control, and irrigation systems. Advanced greenhouses can open the roof to expose the plants to the outdoors gradually without having to move them out of the greenhouse.

Human laborers are a necessary and important part of the plant growing business, however. Caring for growing plants requires continual hands-on care and observation to ensure that the plants are safe and thriving and cannot be replaced with machinery.

With so many variables affecting the success of the growing plants, nurseries use automated systems to do the watering and temperature adjustments, but the human hands and eyes are necessary also.
