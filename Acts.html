    <h1>ACTS</h1>
    <h2><u>Bishnoi's Movement</u></h2>
    <p>After this incident, the maharaja gave a strong royal decree preventing the cutting of trees in all Bishnoi villages. 
        The concept of tree-hugging and tree huggers has roots in the history of Bishnoism in the year of 1730 A.D. 
        This movement and sacrifice not only inspired the Chipko Movement in the 20th Century which was led by Sunder 
        Lal Bahuguna but also the Government of India in the form of the “Amrita Devi Bishnoi Wildlife Protection Award” and Government of Rajasthan 
        n the form of “Amrita Devi Bishnoi Smrithi Paryavaran Award” for contributing to the protection of wildlife and environment conservation respectively.</p>
        <h2><u>Chipko Movement</u></h2>
        <p>he movement originated in 1973 at the Himalayan region of Uttarakhand (then part of Uttar Pradesh) and went on to become a rallying point for many future
         environmental movements all over the world. It created a precedent for starting nonviolent protest in India.[1] However, it was Sunderlal Bahuguna a Gandhian activist, 
         who gave the movement a proper direction and its success meant that the world immediately took notice of this non-violent movement, which was to inspire in time many similar
        eco-groups by helping to slow down the rapid deforestation, expose vested interests, increase social awareness and the need to save trees, increase ecological awareness, and demonstrate
         the viability of people power. He used the slogan "Ecology is the permanent economy". Above all, it stirred up the existing civil society in India, which began to address the issues of tribal and marginalized people.
         And it's true that the support for the movement came mainly from the womenfolk. The Chipko Andolan or the Chipko movement is a movement that practiced methods of Satyagraha where both male and female activists from 
        Uttarakhand played vital roles, including Gaura Devi, Suraksha Devi,
         Sudesha Devi, Bachni Devi and Chandi Bhatt, Virushka Devi and others.</p>
         <h2><u>Jungle Bachao Andholan</u></h2>
         <p>In the early 1980s, the Jungle Bachao Andolan took shape when the government proposed to replace 
        the natural Sal forest of Singhbhum District, Bihar (now Jharkhand), with commercial teak plantations. 
        The Jungle Bachao Andolan movement is said to have originated in Bihar and slowly spread to states 
        like Jharkhand and Odisha.</p>
